===========
This is where you will find the current progress for the design files of the 2014-2015 electrical system revisions. Listed below are links to informative sources regarding design progress.

* Detailed tracking of most electrical subtasks are found on the [RoboJackets Wiki](http://wiki.robojackets.org/w/RoboCup:_Redesign_2014-2015).
* Oscilloscope captures of the 2011 robot's electrical systems can be found in the [/firmware/robot/cpu/data](https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software/tree/master/firmware/robot/cpu/tools) directory of the [robocup-software](https://github.com/robojackets/robocup-software) repository.
** There are currently python scripts for analysis of this data in the ['/firmware/robot/cpu/tools'](https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software/tree/master/firmware/robot/cpu/tools) directory of the [robocup-software](https://github.com/robojackets/robocup-software) repository.
* The current robot's electrical design files are found in the [`/archive-pcb`] directory of this repository.
